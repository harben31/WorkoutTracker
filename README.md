## Description:
An app where the user can track their workouts throughout the week

## Technologies_Used
* Node.js
* Express.js
* MongoDb
* Mongoose.js
* Chart.js
* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript

## Usage:
On load the user is presented with the stats of their most recent workout and the option to continue that workout or start a new workout. Either button brings the user to an add exercise page; if the user had clicked new workout this exercise will be added to a new document and if the user had selected add to current workout the exercise will be added to the existing document. Once the user is on the add exercise page they have the option to choose between two types of exercises and will be presented with different options for either. Once the user clicks add exercise or complete the data will be added to the database. The user can click on the dashboard button to see their workout statistics displayed in several chart forms that will have aggregated data derived from their workout data.
